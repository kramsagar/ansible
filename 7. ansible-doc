module: file

short_description: Manage files and file properties
extends_documentation_fragment: [files, action_common_attributes]
description:
- Set attributes of files, symlinks or directories.
- Alternatively, remove files, symlinks or directories.
- Many other modules support the same options as the C(file) module - including M(ansible.builtin.copy),
  M(ansible.builtin.template), and M(ansible.builtin.assemble).
- For Windows targets, use the M(ansible.windows.win_file) module instead.
options:
  path:
    description:
    - Path to the file being managed.
    type: path
    required: yes
    aliases: [ dest, name ]
  state:
    description:
    - If C(absent), directories will be recursively deleted, and files or symlinks will
      be unlinked. In the case of a directory, if C(diff) is declared, you will see the files and folders deleted listed
      under C(path_contents). Note that C(absent) will not cause C(file) to fail if the C(path) does
      not exist as the state did not change.
    - If C(directory), all intermediate subdirectories will be created if they
      do not exist. Since Ansible 1.7 they will be created with the supplied permissions.
    - If C(file), with no other options, returns the current state of C(path).
    - If C(file), even with other options (such as C(mode)), the file will be mod
