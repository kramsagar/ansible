in RHCE exam, we should use ansible-navigator for clearing the tasks.

ansible-playbook: to execute all ansible playbooks
ansible-navigator: ansible command line tools to execute all playbooks with container env.

Steps:
1. First install: ansible-core
2. install ansible-navigator
3. podman = this is one more command tool, it is container runtime interface (cri-o)

ansible automation platform2.2 pull the images from redhat repostiry. Anible-core contains very specific packages. if we need more modules, then we need to instal user based community installation (python3 pip install ansible)
But to avoid all this necessary module available inside aap2.2 inside one container image.
