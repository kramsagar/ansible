Ansible is built around an agentless architecture. 

Typically, Ansible connects to the hosts it manages by using OpenSSH or WinRM and runs tasks, often (but not always) by pushing out small programs called Ansible modules to those hosts

These programs are used to put the system in a specific desired state.Any modules that are pushed are removed when Ansible has finished its tasks.
