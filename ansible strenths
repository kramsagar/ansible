Ansible has a number of important strengths:
===================================================================================================
Cross platform support: Ansible provides agentless support for Linux, Windows, UNIX, and
network devices, in physical, virtual, cloud, and container environments

Human-readable automation: Ansible Playbooks, written as YAML text files, are easy to read and
help ensure that everyone understands what they do

Precise application descriptions: Every change can be made by Ansible Playbooks, and every
aspect of your application environment can be described and documented.

Easy to manage in version control: Ansible Playbooks and projects are plain text. They can be
treated like source code and placed in your existing version control system.

Support for dynamic inventories: The list of machines that Ansible manages can be dynamically
updated from external sources to capture the correct, current list of all managed servers all the
time, regardless of infrastructure or location.

Orchestration that integrates easily with other systems: HP SA, Puppet, Jenkins, Red Hat
Satellite, and other systems that exist in your environment can be leveraged and integrated into
your Ansible workflow

> Ansible: The Language of DevOps
> Communication is the key to DevOps. Ansible is the first automation language that can be read
and written across IT.
